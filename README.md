# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a browser-based Rock Paper Scissors game built for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Foundations curriculum.

The original version was played through the browser console using prompt input and console logs. This updated version features a full graphical interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Players select Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking buttons. The computer makes a random choice, and the game determines the winner of each round. The first to reach 5 points wins the game, at which point all buttons are disabled.

## Features
- Interactive buttons for player input
- Real-time score tracking
- Win announcement when a player reaches 5 points
